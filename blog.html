            <h2>Teacher Barbie</h2>
            <p>
              We didn't have to expend a lot of creative juices to come up with a teacher 
              Barbie, everyone knows what a teacher is supposed to look like! This one has 
              glasses and a whole host of classroom essentials, after all, most teachers 
              are so dedicated to their work that they go out and buy their own materials. 
              Whether it's for a church sermon, or a class full of Kindergarteners, you'll 
              see teachers doing whatever it takes to get their point across. On a Dream 
              Team, you need a teacher to help you keep in line with the Word of God. 
              They'll correct you and help you stay on the right path.

          <h2>Prophetic Barbie</h2>
          <p>
            Prophets did weird things in the Bible. John the Baptist ate locusts and 
            dressed in camel hair. Isaiah walked around naked. Ezekiel laid on his left 
            side for 390 days. Sometimes prophets are strange, and so is this Barbie. 
            Being primarily concerned about hearing the voice of God and following his 
            heart makes you stand out on a team. This Barbie looks a little mystic, like 
            she knows something we don't. She may be an odd ball, but she's a critical 
            component of a Dream Team. Without being constantly grounded by the voice of 
            God, how would any church planting team hope to reach the lost?

          <h2>Apostolic Barbie</h2>
          <p>
            Apostolic Barbie is ready for action! Apostles are constantly moving the 
            mission forward, innovating & deploying people on mission. Here, Barbie has 
            her briefcase and her cell phone like she's ready to give people marching 
            orders and put them to work where they're needed most. She's an entrepreneurial
            self-starter. Apostles serve a team by keeping us from getting too comfortable 
            with the status quo. If you're going to have a Barbie Dream Team, you can 
            leave out this mobilizing force!

          <h2>Evangelist Barbie</h2>
          <p>
            Evangelists are loud! Hey, we don't make the rules, we're just illustrating 
            them. Evangelists are loud because they want everybody to hear the gospel. And 
            make no mistake, everyone does need to hear the gospel. That's why evangelists 
            are such an important part of a Dream Team. This Barbie has a microphone and 
            is ready to blast out her message to anybody that will listen. And she has 
            pink hair because the prophets aren't the only ones that have a little 
            quirkiness to them.

          <h2>Shepherd Barbie</h2>
          <p>
            This Barbie sort of looks like The Church Lady from Saturday Night Live, and 
            that seems appropriate. A lot of the "churchy" things we do are shepherding 
            activities. Shepherds are concerned about community and the people of God. 
            They help take care of people, and that's often (but certainly not always) 
            stereotypical church ministries. So Barbie has her cross, her frock, and 
            probably has a big 'ole Bible in that bag of hers. We need some shepherds on 
            our team to make sure we take care of people.
